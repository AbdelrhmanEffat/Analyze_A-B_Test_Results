This project involves analyzing A/B test results from an e-commerce website to help the company decide whether to implement a new webpage, keep the existing one, or extend the testing period. The notebook is structured into various sections, including Probability, A/B Test, and Regression, and involves tasks such as importing data, cleaning datasets, conducting probability analysis, and applying statistical tests.
The aim of this analysis is to:
•	Evaluate the effectiveness of the new webpage compared to the old one in terms of conversion rates.
•	Apply statistical methods (such as hypothesis testing, ANOVA, and regression analysis) to assess whether observed differences are statistically significant.
•	Provide actionable insights based on the analysis to guide the company’s decision on webpage implementation.
